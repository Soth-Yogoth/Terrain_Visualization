# Terrain 3D Visualization

This program is a Java Script application that generates a 3D visualization of terrain based on a height map and display it in any chromium browser. It uses Three.js library to create the 3D scene. You can find more information about Three.js and its documentation on their [official website](https://threejs.org/).

You can modify the code in the main.js file: change the map, texture, lighting, and other visual aspects of the scene.
